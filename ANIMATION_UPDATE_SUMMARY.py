âœ¨ Slide-Down Exit Effect:
   â€¢ Images slide down to bottom of screen when exiting
   â€¢ Smooth easing animation with ease-in cubic function
   â€¢ Clean, polished exit animation

âœ¨ Intelligent Animation Timing:
   â€¢ Animation duration adapts to overlay duration
   â€¢ Minimum 0.6 seconds for smooth motion
   â€¢ Balanced timing (1/3 of total duration max)

âœ¨ Enhanced Visual Polish:
   â€¢ Fade in/out effects combined with slide animation
   â€¢ Centered positioning during main display time
   â€¢ Smooth transitions between animation phases

ðŸ”§ TECHNICAL IMPROVEMENTS:
--------------------------
âœ… Updated add_image_overlay() function in vid_editor/utils.py:
   â€¢ Custom position function for slide animations
   â€¢ Improved error handling and edge case management
